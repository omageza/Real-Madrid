        Founded on 6 March 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since inception.
        <br> The word real is Spanish for "royal" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII 
        in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. The team has played its home matches in the
         81,044-capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities,
          Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history.<br><br>

        The club was estimated to be worth €3.8 billion ($4.2 billion) in 2019, and it was the second 
        highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €757.3 million in 2019.<br>
         The club is one of the most widely supported teams in the world.<br> Real Madrid is one of three founding
          members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, 
          along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona.<br> The club holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably El
           Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid.<br><br>
        
        Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s,
         winning five consecutive European Cups and reaching the final seven times.<br> This success was replicated 
         in the league, which the club won five times in the space of seven years.<br> This team, which included
          Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Francisco Gento, and Raymond Kopa, is considered by some in the 
          sport to be the greatest team of all time.<br><br>
        
        In domestic football, the club has won 66 trophies; a record 34 La Liga titles, 19 Copa del Rey,
         11 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte, and a Copa de la Liga.<br> In European and worldwide competitions,
          Real Madrid have won a record 26 trophies; a record 13 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, 
          two UEFA Cups and four UEFA Super Cups.<br> In international football, they have achieved a record seven 
          club world championships.<br><br>
        
        Real Madrid was recognised as the FIFA Club of the 20th Century on 11 December 2000 with 42.35% of the vote,
         and received the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit on 20 May 2004.<br> The club was also awarded Best European
          Club of the 20th Century by the IFFHS on 11 May 2010.<br> In June 2017, the team succeeded in becoming the first 
          club to win consecutive Champions League titles, then made it three in a row and four in five seasons in May
           2018, extending their lead atop the UEFA club rankings. As of 2020, Real Madrid are ranked third behind 
           Bayern Munich and Barcelona.<br><br>

        </div>
        <p>
            Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students
             of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates.<br>
              They founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was 
              the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members
               caused some of them to leave and create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of Football),
                to distinguish themselves from Sky Football.<br>
                 Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós
                  and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid.<br>
                   In 1901 this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902,
                    Sky was renamed as "New Foot-Ball Club".<br>
                     On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football 
                     Club was officially founded.<br>
          </p>
          
          <br><br>
          <p>
            Three years after its foundation, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao
             in the Spanish Cup final.<br> The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football
              Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA.<br>
               After moving between grounds the team moved to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912.<br> In 1920, the club's
                name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club<br>

            <p>
            In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded.<br>
             Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, 
             meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.<br>
              Real Madrid won its first League title in
              the 1931–32 season and retained the title the following year.<br>
            
            On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the
             title Real and went back to being named Madrid Football Club.<br> Football continued during
              the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943 Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg 
              of a semi-final of the Copa del Generalísimo, the Copa del Rey having been renamed in 
              honour of General Franco.<br>
               It has been suggested Barcelona players were intimidated by police,
               including by the director of state security who "allegedly told the team that some of them
                were only playing because of the regime's generosity in permitting them to remain in the country.<br>
                 The Barcelona chairman, Enrique Piñeyro, was assaulted by Madrid fans.<br> However, 
                 none of these allegations have been proven and FIFA and UEFA still consider the 
                 result as legitimate.<br> According to Spanish journalist and writer, Juan Carlos Pasamontes,
                  Barcelona player Josep Valle denied that the Spanish security forces came before the match.<br>
                   Instead, at the end of the first half, Barcelona coach Juan José Nogués and all of his players
                    were angry with the hard-style of play Real Madrid was using and with the aggressiveness 
                    of the home crowd.[29] When they refused to take the field, the Superior Chief of Police 
                    of Madrid appeared, identified himself, and ordered the team to take the field.<br>

            Santiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1945.<br> Under his presidency,
             the club, its stadium Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol and its training facilities Ciudad 
             Deportiva were rebuilt after the Spanish Civil War damages.<br>
              Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded 
              Real Madrid's youth academy, or "cantera," known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953,
               he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent
                being Alfredo Di Stéfano.<br>

        <p>
            In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu,
             Bedrignan and Gusztáv Sebes created a tournament for the champions teams around Europe, under invitation, that 
              eventually become what today is known as the UEFA Champions League.<br> It was under Bernabéu's guidance 
              that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football.<br>
               The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden 
               Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.<br>
                After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earning the
                 right to wear the UEFA badge of honor.<br><br>
                 The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966 defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed
                  entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[34] This team became known as the Yé-yé.<br>
                   The name "Yé-yé" came from the "Yeah, yeah, yeah" chorus in The Beatles' song "She Loves You" after four
                    members of the team posed for Marca and impersonated the Beatles.<br>
                     The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962 and 1964.<br>
                      In the 1970s, Real Madrid won five league championships and three Spanish Cups.<br>
                       The club played its first UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final in 1971 and lost to English side Chelsea 2–1.<br>
                        On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina.<br>
                         FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the tournament.<br> The following year, the club 
                         organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in memory of its former president.<br><br>
